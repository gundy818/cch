= cch

cch is a cache for the results of command line programs. If you have a command line
program that is expensiv=e to run, but that produces the same results every time, then
you can run it with cch instead. cch will check whether it has run recently with the
same arguments, and if so it will return the cached results. The results returned are
the stdout, stderr and return code from the command.


== Future plans

- allow checking md5s of input files etc so it knows when the output will change.
